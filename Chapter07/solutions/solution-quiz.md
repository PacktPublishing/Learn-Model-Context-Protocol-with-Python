What can a client access on an MCP server?

A: Prompts, Tools and Resources.
B: Tools, Prompts and Services.
C: Tools and Prompts.


**A**, prompts, tools and resources are the three key features an MCP server can provide. Services are not a feature of MCP.

What's the benefit of adding an LLM to your client?

A: It's better to place the LLM on the Server.
B: It makes the client faster.
C: an LLM on the client allows the end user to use prompts to interact with the server which makes for a much better user experience.

**C** is correct. The idea is that the client acts as an agent that can talk to many different servers and the MCP servers merely provide features that the client/agent can use. The role of LLM is to make the client easier to use by being able to understand natural language requests. Therefore, the LLM belongs on the client.

# Running this code

There are two different code projects:

- [Validation](./validation/README.md), showing how to validate incoming MCP requests.
- [OAuth](./oauth/README.md), showing how a basic OAuth 2.1 authorization code flow works, it does not use MCP SDK but is meant to give you the knowledge needed to leverage what's in the MCP SDK.

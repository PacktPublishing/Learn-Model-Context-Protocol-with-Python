How do you install an MCP Server?

- A: You can install them the way you install extensions in Visual Studio Code. 
- B: You run `mcp install <server name>` in the terminal.
- C: Servers are installed by adding text entries to `mcp.json`. You also need to specify type how to start it or where the server resides. 

**A and C**. Thanks to the official registry just being added to Visual Studio Code Insider, you can type "@mcp" and install servers like you would an extension. You can also add servers via the command palette or adding it as entries in a `mcp.json` file.
